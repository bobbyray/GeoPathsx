<h2>GeoTrail Privacy Policy</h2>
<h3>Geolocation</h3>
<p>Geolocation is used by this app to show your location on a map with respect to a trail that you have selected,
or to record a trail as you travel. Warnings, which you control, can be shown by the app when your geolocation
is off the trail you have selected.</p>
<p>If you choose not to allow this app to use geolocation, the app will not be useful.</p>
At your option, you may save geolocation data to define a trail. Also you may choose
to save statistics for a walk or recorded trail.
<h3>Web Server Data</h3>
<p>For trails, that you define manually or record by using geolocation, 
data is stored on a web server. The data has latitude and longitude for points
defining the trail. A unique identifier is associated with your trails.</p>
<p>For a walk or a trail you record, statistics are saved optionally at
a web server. The statistics are a summary, such as start time, distance, and run time,
and do not include any geolocation. Your unique identifier is associated with your statistics.</p>
<p>Your unique identifier and your name associated with it are saved in the database at the web server.</p>
<p> Protection for the database is provided through access controlled by a password. 
Data exchanges with the server are encrypted via the https protocol.
The web hosting company
provides security against malicious intrusions. However,
be aware that data could be obtained illegally by hackers or legally by an authorized governmental authority.</p>
<p>The app lets you delete your trails from the web server.</p>
<h3>Data on Your Phone</h3>
<p>Data is saved on your phone for defining trails and caching map sections when you are offline. 
Also statistics for walks and trails that you record are saved on your phone.
<p>If from this app you sign your unique identifier and name are saved on the phone; 
when from this app you logout, your identifier and name are removed.</p>
<p>The data can be deleted by you from your phone by managing the application on your phone.</p>
<h3>Making Your Trails Public or Private</h3>
<p>When you define a trail you mark it as Public or Private. If a trail is Public, it can be seen by anyone
using this app. If the trail is marked Private, the trail is only visible by you when using the app.
However, from the app you can never see the unique identifier or name of another user who has made
a trail public.
<h3>Your Data Is Not Shared with Any Other Party</h3>
As mentioned above, your unique identifier is associated with the 
geolocation data for a trail you have defined and for statistics for a trail that you have recorded.
Marking a trail you save to the web server as Public allows others using this app to view the trail.
The statistics for a trail you record can only be seen by you. 
<p>Your geolocation data, your statistics for your recorded trails, 
your unique identifier, or your name are never given to another party.
