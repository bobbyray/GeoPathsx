<h2>GeoTrail Privacy Policy</h2>
<h3>Geolocation</h3>
<p>Geolocation is used by this app to show your location on a map with respect to a trail that you have selected,
or to record a trail as you travel. Warnings, which you control, can be shown by the app when your geolocation
is off the trail you have selected.</p>
<p>If you choose not to allow this app to use geolocation, the app will not be useful.</p>
At your option, you may save geolocation data to define a trail on a web server.
<h3>Web Server Data</h3>
<p>For trails, that you define manually or record by using geolocation, 
data is stored on a web server. The data has latitude and longitude for points
defining the trail. Your Facebook public identifier (not your name) is associated with your trails.
Protection for the database is provided through access controlled by a password. 
Data exchanges with the server are encrypted via the https protocol.
The web hosting company
provides security against malicious intrusions. However,
be aware that data could be obtained illegally by hackers or legally by an authorized governmental authority.</p>
<h3>Data on Your Phone</h3>
<p>Data is saved on your phone for defining trails and caching map sections when you are offline.
<p>If from this app you sign in using Facebook, your Facebook public identifier is saved on the phone; 
when from this app you logout, your identifier is removed.</p>
<p>The data can be deleted by you from your phone by managing the application on your phone.</p>
<h3>Making Your Trails Public or Private</h3>
<p>When you define a trail you mark it as Public or Private. If a trail is Public, it can be seen by anyone
using this app. If the trail is marked Private, the trail is only visible by you when using the app.
<h3>Your Data Is Not Shared with Any Other Party</h3>
As mentioned above, your Facebook public identifier is associated with the 
geolocation data for a trail you have defined. 
Marking a trail you save to the web server as Public allows others using this app to view the trail.
However, neither the geolocation data nor the Facebook public identifier is ever given to another party.
